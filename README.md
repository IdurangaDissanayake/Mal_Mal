Malicious website detection Chrome extension

Mal Mal was made by keeping in mind the regular internet user who has to go through many websites during his time on the internet and may fall under the trap of a malicious website who might want the user's information or want to introduce malware in their system. Chrome extension helps the user to check a particular website whether it is safe for browsing or not we have used a pretrained ML model to do so.
